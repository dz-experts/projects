# Contributing

## Guidelines

* Fork the repo.
* See the README file for how to launch a quick local preview website (Don't worry, it's simple).
* If you just want to update the content, you'll mainly only need to modify the files in `docs/`
* When modifying the content, add a section if needed.
    * Add the section description.
    * Add the section title to Table of Contents.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Remove any trailing whitespace.
* Ensure you have added new content in the three languages (AR, EN and FR), or open a new Issue if you need help translating.
* Send back a Pull Request to the main repo.
